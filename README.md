Zookal FixFormKey
===================

This module solves the issue where the form key will be cached in a block.

This modules creates a placeholder in the cached block and replaces later the placeholder
with the correct form key. The same replacement as with the session ID.

The modifications have been done in `Mage_Core_Block_Abstract` with its methods `_loadCache()`
and `_saveCache()`. The placeholder is generated in `_getFormKeyPlaceholder()`. Another solution is not possible.

## Compatible only with Magento CE >= 1.8 and EE >= 1.13
